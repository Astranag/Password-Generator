## ðŸ’» USAGE

[Visit the webpage here](https://astranag.github.io/Password-Generator/)

This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS (provided starter code) powered by JavaScript code that I've written. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### ðŸ’¬ User story

```
As a user,
I WANT to use the app,
SO THAT I can generate passwords that fit my criteria
```

```
GIVEN the password generator app

WHEN I click on the "generate password" button
THEN I can see pop up windows where I can specify the password length and the types of characters I want to include

WHEN I specify all the criteria,
THEN I can see a corresponding password on the screen

```

### âœ… Acceptance Criteria

It's done when:

-  the user selects a password length between 8 and 128
-  the user selects at least 1 character type to be included in the password
-  a password respecting the user's criteria is generated
-  Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
-  Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
